								<p>As an undergraduate student researcher, I was able to participate in a roadside barrier automobile emissions project which was funded by CalTrans. The purpose of this study was to assess the impact of automobile air pollutants on areas near a large highway with a roadside barrier. In order to accomplish this our research group set up air sample collection devices at varying distances from the highway then emitted a tracer gas from the tailpipes of all vehicles in our fleet of a dozen vehicles while the air sample was being collected. We then took all of the samples back to the lab and determined the concentrations of tracer gas in each sample and tabulated the data. </p>
							</ul>

							<ul>
								<p><span class="image right"><img src="images/RSBP1.jpg" alt="" /></span>I had many roles in this study which included: manufacturing air sample storage bags, building air sample collection devices, setting up data collection devices in the study area, assembling tracer gas emission systems, operating tracer gas emission systems, managing video collection systems, and tabulating data in Microsoft Excel. Building air sample collection devices consisted of assembling totes which contained 6 small pumps connected to a 12V battery and a single board computer (SBC). The SBCs, pumps, and batteries required a bit of soldering and the SBCs had to be tested to make sure each had a functioning clock as the purpose of the SBC was to run each pump for the desired amount of time during the study period. In total, we built about 50 air sample collection devices that had to each be taken from the lab to a respective data collection location and be properly programmed to run at the correct time during each study period. In order to assemble each tracer gas emission system, a copper pipe was routed from a tracer gas cylinder onboard the automobile to the tailpipe of the vehicle along with a thermocouple which collected temperatures throughout the study period. As an operator of the tracer gas emission system, I was required to drive an automobile in the study area and flip a switch to release the tracer gas on the desired section of the freeway. A task I was in charge of for this study was filming the section of the freeway that was being analyzed so that the number of cars and commercial trucks traveling in both directions of the freeway during the study period could be counted. Another task I was in charge of was setting up Sonic Anemometers and Aethelometers to run during the study period and to tabulate the data collected by these devices in Microsoft Excel. This study gave me the opportunity to act as a leader of a group of students who were less familiar with our lab practices and get personal instruction from my project scientist and the principal investigator. </p>

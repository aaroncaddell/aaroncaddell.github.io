								<p>My internship at M&M Engineering gave me the opportunity to learn a great deal about manufacturing while working directly under their senior engineer. In this internship position, I was assigned projects by the senior engineer which included projects aimed to optimize the manufacturing processes carried out at the machine shop as well as some design projects. In order to optimize manufacturing processes at the machine shop, the senior engineer was working to implement lean manufacturing throughout the organization. My role in implementing this ideology included conducting time trials on machines with suboptimal output, organizing collets and bushings to minimize time wasted during setup, and developing daily management boards in order to keep all projects and their respective parts being run on the shop floor in order. </p>
							</ul>

									<p><span class="image left"><img src="images/SP2.png" alt="" /></span>One of my design projects was to design a washdown system for a machine that had to be cleaned often because of chip buildup. I was also responsible for designing a sine plate using Fusion 360 which is a CAD program I had not previously used. The sine plate was to be usable on any machine in the shop and allow for angled cuts to be made. This internship allowed me to learn a new CAD program but also gain a better understanding of the manufacturing process.</p>

                                <p>NASA plans to return to the moon in 2024 with the Artemis Program which will be the first manned moon missions since 1972. 
									A key component of a manned moon mission is the collection of geological samples from the lunar surface. My senior design 
									group was tasked with designing the Dust-Tolerant Loose Sample Device as part of the NASA Micro-G NExT program. The purpose 
									of this device is to collect “float” samples, which are small loose rocks which lay on the lunar surface. The design must abide 
									by the requirements set by NASA which include: </p>
							</ul>

							<ul>
								<li>The device shall be able to pick up float samples ranging 0.5” to 3” in diameter. </li>
								<li>The device shall be able to function as intended after being fully submerged in lunar dust
									simulant. The device will be fully submerged, removed from the lunar dust simulant, and
									then cycled 10 times.</li>
								<li>The device shall use only manual power. </li>
								<li>The device shall be a minimum of 30” and a maximum of 35” in length to allow the
									subject to collect a float sample without bending over. </li>
								<li>The device must be operable with EVA gloved hands (like heavy ski gloves). </li>
								<li>The total weight of all parts you provide should be less than 3 lbs. </li>
								<li>Tools must not have holes or openings which would allow/cause entrapment of fingers. </li>
								<li>Tools should be made from Aluminum 6061, Aluminum 7075, Stainless Steel (any series), or Teflon. 
									Any other materials must get prior approval from the EVA Tools POC. 
								</li>
								<li>Lubricants must be selected from the NBL approved lubricant list or a waiver must be granted.  </li>
								<li>There shall be no sharp edges on the tool.</li>
								<li>Pinch points should be minimized and labeled.</li>
							</ul>
							


									<p>Acting as the Team Leader, I was responsible for ensuring that workloads were distributed fairly amongst team
										 members and that all deadlines were met. As a team, we underwent the design process and proposed over forty designs
										  which we narrowed down to just a few before using a weighted decision matrix to choose our final design.
									</p>
									<span class="image left"><img src="images/SDPtop.png" alt="" /></span>The final design chosen for this project was a simple grabbing mechanism
										 which is actuated when the user applies a force to the top of the handle of the device. This design has a large emphasis on simplicity
										  which allows for a high level of dust tolerance which was of the highest priority for this device.</p>
									
										<span class="image right"><img src="images/SDPmillpic.png" alt="" /></span> Upon reaching a refined version of the final design we created a 3D
										 model of the design using Solidworks and tested it using Solidworks Simulation. Solidworks Simulation allowed us to virtually drop test
										  the device and test the device’s ability to withstand the extreme temperatures it would experience on the lunar surface. We also used
										   Matlab to calculate the ideal material thickness which allowed for the desired plate deflection.</p>

									<span>Once the final design was approved by our project advisor our group began manufacturing a prototype. Many manufacturing processes were
										 used to build the prototype; these processes included the use of a vertical milling machine, lathe, wire EDM, 3D printing, welding, and
										  riveting. The manufacturing of this prototype allowed us to learn how to operate these machines while also allowing us to deliver a 
										  functional final product. </p>
